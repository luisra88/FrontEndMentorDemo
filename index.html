My name is Luis Muniz and I am a software developer. I am building this website to showcase my skills as well as experience. 
This website has been built from scratch using HTML SASS and Javascript. I intend to host this website using AWS and its services. 
I am native from Puerto Rico but have been living in California since October 2012 and am looking to stay. Moved at first with intentions
of returning after two years but quickly became in love with the weather and culture that makes California so great. While living here
I discovered my passion for traveling and experimenting new cultures and places. I have been to several countries and intend for the list 
to keep growing. Lately I have started visiting Mexico more often and am now dating someone from that country and am concentrating in visiting
and experimenting more of its culture.
